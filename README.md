# Yelp - Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

## What is Object Relational Mapping?
Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to construct their own ORM tools.

## What is ODB?
ODB is an object-relational modeling framework (https://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/doc/manual.xhtml) used as the main package behind this repository.

## Data Analytics

As a Proof of Concept, the following Data Analytics were extracted from our object representation:

### Finds the opening hours of all restaurants a user has rated

### Calculates a histogram of all reviews for all businesses within an area

### Creates Microsoft's columnstore indices for selected columns

## Performance Optimisations

### Vectors as element containers

### Unordered Sets
